This is a quick little project using PHP, JS, HTML, and CSS. It reads from an online csv file that contains New York City restaurant inspections. It can be accessed at http://wicked-wagon-wheel-99-160008.use1.nitrousbox.com/? but that may become inaccessible at any time. There's an explanation a folder down with a scheme diagram about how the underlying DB has been set up. This could be extended further in the future for more details such as graphs, spinners, and more detailed search options.
